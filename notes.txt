Bubble sort:
- Adjacent elements are compared, with a swap done each time the element on the right is lesser.
- Every time all the pairs of elements have been compared, a pass has been completed.
- The time complexity is O(n^2).

Selection sort:
- For every consecutive pass, the number of comparisons done
decreases by 1, starting with n comparisons on the first pass.
- This is because every time a new maxPos is found and swapped appropiately,
that value has now been put in its correct position, decreasing the remaining
unsorted values by 1.
- The sum of the number of comparisons for each pass: 
  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2, which has a degree of 2
- Therefore, selection sort has an average time complexity of O(n^2).

Insertion sort:
- Involves a sorted and unsorted region
- The sorted region starts off with 1 value (since a 1-value list can be considered sorted)
and increases by 1 each time a new value is transferred from the unsorted list to sorted.
- The time complexity is O(n^2).
