Bubble sort:

Selection sort:
- For every consecutive pass, the number of comparisons done
decreases by 1, starting with n comparisons on the first pass.
- This is because every pass has a new element guranteed in place.
- The sum of the number of comparisons for each pass: 
  1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2, which has a degree of 2
- Therefore, selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Insertion sort:
